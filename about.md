First of all, I'm hugely thankful for your presence here.
This blog is made by me. Its design is very close to <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>, I was inspired by this fantastic application. I wanted that my stories look similar with some light touches on the top.

Why I wanted to do it at my own? Because <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> is limited once I'd like to write some very customized posts which require more options.

What I'm doing here is sharing my ideas and thoughts, it helps me to get better, so I'll do it.

You can see also these posts by visiting my page at <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a>

And by the way you will get to know this website. If you feel inspired, try to start sharing your thoughts too, I would like to read!

Cheers!
