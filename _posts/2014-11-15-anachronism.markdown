<code class="quote">It’s the 15th century, in the middle of a spring night. In a calm room with the candles shining their lights all over the place, I’m sitting in an archaic chair, in front of my table, pen and paper. The wooden floors below my chair reflects some of the light’s colour. I’m listening to the sound of my pen on the paper writing, murmuring above.</code>

My love to the past is sturdy than how it is to the present. It has many enlightened people who understood what really life is and channelled the world into a tremendous progress in art and science.

Today, we think that with our technology we are reinventing life. But this is not the case. Although the few tools that we have today are useful, but they are minor details regarding to life and deep understanding. The essence of life remains unchanged, we still lone souls degraded by invisible powers coming across the what we read and see everyday.

Tomorrow, what I’m learning today from the media and internet will be redundant. People are publishing information which each seems to blend together into a meaningless jargon. Their principle reason is to make headlines and build traffic, but most of them ignore that amid those there is no enduring value.

The past will not help you to forecast weather as today, and will not help you to code a website either, but it will teach you what it means to be a human, and how to live. Our most reliable asset is the wisdom of the greatest human minds passed through centuries.

I was always awestruck by the following quote of one of the greatest minds, Albert Einstein.

<blockquote class="phil">
<code class="quote">
Somebody who reads only newspapers and at best the books of contemporary authors looks to me like an extremely nearsighted person who scorns eyeglasses. He is completely dependent on the prejudices and fashions of his times, since he never gets to see or hear anything else. And what a person thinks on his own without being stimulated by the thoughts and experiences of other people is even in the best case rather paltry and monotonous. <br> <br>
There are only a few enlightened people with a lucid mind and style and with good taste with a century. What has been preserved of their work belongs among the most precious possessions of mankind. <br> <br>
Nothing is more needed than to overcome the modernist’s snobbishness. <br> <br>
Albert Einstein.</code>
